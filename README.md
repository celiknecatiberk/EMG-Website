# EMG-Website
Website control with EMG sensors (Read README.md for details)

The aim of our Completion Project is to perform the upward, downward, right, left and click movements with the categorized data and the cursor within the website by inserting the perceived muscle movements, machine learning into various algorithms. The project I uploaded to Github is the website part of my graduation project.

In order to regularly view the website and examine it in detail, you need to run the codes on the local host and add the emg.sql file to the database.
